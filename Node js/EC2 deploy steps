✅ Step 1: Launch EC2 Instance
Go to AWS Console → EC2 → Launch Instance

Select Ubuntu 22.04 LTS as the AMI

Choose instance type: t2.micro (Free Tier)

Create or select a key pair (required even if not used)

In Network Settings (Security Group), allow the following ports:

Port 22 (SSH)

Port 3000 (for Node.js web app access)

Launch the instance



✅ Step 2: Connect Using EC2 Instance Connect
Go to AWS EC2 Dashboard → Instances

Select your instance

Click the Connect button

Choose the EC2 Instance Connect (browser-based SSH) tab

Click Connect to open a terminal in your browser



✅ Step 3: Install Required Software (on EC2)
Run the following commands in the browser terminal:

Update packages

Install Node.js and npm

Install Git (if you're cloning your project)




✅ Step 4: Upload or Clone the Project
You can either:

Use Git to clone a repository

Or use scp from your local machine to upload project files to the instance

After upload or cloning, navigate into the project directory and run npm install to install dependencies.



✅ Step 5: Start the Application
Inside the project folder, start your Node.js application using node server.js.
Make sure your app is configured to listen on port 3000.




✅ Step 6: View the Website
Open your browser and visit:
http://<EC2-PUBLIC-IP>:3000

Replace <EC2-PUBLIC-IP> with the public IPv4 address of your EC2 instance (found in the EC2 dashboard).
